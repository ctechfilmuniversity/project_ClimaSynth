# Prototype Development

- Develop scenes according to sound recordings, climate scenarios and storytelling: each scene as a chapter (explore different locations and mic types) (Eleni)
  * Environmental sonic states based on: listening perspectives (i.e., from within plants, landscape overviews), shifting frequencies, other temporalities
  * Drought: wet/dry contrasts
- App documentation + presentation mode (user interface - computer/phone via OSC?) (Danylo)
- Max/js/WebAudio connections (Danylo)
- Alpha testing including app demo (Danylo, Eleni), questionnaire and organization (Eleni)
- Map interface + connection with synth
