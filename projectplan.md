# Prototype Development

- Develop scenes according to sound recordings, climate scenarios and storytelling: each scene as a chapter (explore different locations and mic types) (Eleni)
  * Environmental sonic states based on: listening perspectives (i.e., from within plants, landscape overviews), shifting frequencies (i.e., pitch variations/biodiversity), other temporalities (i.e., stretched or accelerated time), states of matter (i.e., wet/dry, liquid/solid contrasts)
- App documentation + presentation mode (user interface - computer/phone via OSC?) including option to record audio (Danylo)
- Audio status and option to record in app (Danylo)
- Max/js/WebAudio connections (Danylo)
- Alpha testing including app demo (Danylo, Eleni), questionnaire and organization (Eleni): 17.01 Pitching and Peer-Review Creative Technologies
- Map/visual interface + connection with synth
